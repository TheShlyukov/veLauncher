# veLauncher
Simple minecraft Launcher on python

No root needed

for GUI version see "releases"

if you run source code:

Before running program, install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Currently, launcher is compiled only for windows. Use source code to run on MacOS and Linux.
Please run source code via terminal, to have ability to view log
(in alpha 0.1.1 and above you can run without terminal, just running .py file via IDE)

(In alpha 0.1.3(.1), the log is not displayed in the terminal (including the status bar). Now log is in the .log file, and you can still view status bar in launcher window)

if you have trouble with PyQt, use classic version (not GUI)

Supports: Windows, MacOS, Linux.
